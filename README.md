## Tools Used
- **Azure Data Studio** ‚Üí Database management and querying raw transaction data.  
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Üí Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using:  
  - **Power Query** ‚Üí For ETL (extract, transform, load).  
  - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Üí For custom measures and calculated columns.
  -  
```
Important SQL Queries worth documenting include;
1Ô∏è‚É£ Aggregate total transaction value and count by transaction type
SELECT 
    TransactionType,
    COUNT(TransactionID) AS TotalTransactions,
    SUM(TransactionValue) AS TotalValue,
    AVG(TransactionValue) AS AvgTransactionValue
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY TransactionType
ORDER BY TotalValue DESC;

```
``` 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze channel preference segmented by customer generation
SELECT 
    c.Generation,
    t.Channel,
    COUNT(t.TransactionID) AS TotalTransactions,
    SUM(t.TransactionValue) AS TotalValue
FROM Customers c
JOIN Transactions t 
    ON c.CustomerID = t.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.Generation, t.Channel
ORDER BY c.Generation, TotalTransactions DESC;

```

##  Data Preparation and Cleaning
